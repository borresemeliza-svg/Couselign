### Recent Bug Fixes
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Counselor history reports data filtering bug:
  - **Issue**: Counselor history reports were showing data from ALL counselors instead of only the logged-in counselor
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: 
    - **Primary Issue**: JavaScript was calling the WRONG endpoint - `admin/history-reports/historical-data` instead of `counselor/history-reports/historical-data`
    - **Secondary Issue**: Missing counselor filtering in both `getHistoryData()` and `getHistoricalData()` methods in `HistoryReports` controller
  - **Security Impact**: Data privacy violation - counselors could see other counselors' appointment data
  - **Data Accuracy Impact**: Incorrect data visualization and reporting for individual counselors
  - **Solution**: 
    - **Frontend Fix**: Changed JavaScript endpoint from `admin/history-reports/historical-data` to `counselor/history-reports/historical-data`
    - **Backend Fix**: Added proper counselor filtering to match the working pattern from `GetAllAppointments` controller
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `public/js/counselor/history_reports.js` - Fixed endpoint URL
    - `app/Controllers/Counselor/HistoryReports.php` - Added counselor filtering
  - **Result**: Both frontend and backend now properly work together to show only data for the logged-in counselor
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Admin appointments data rendering issues:
  - **Issue**: Both `admin/appointments` and `admin/appointments/scheduled` pages were returning 500 Internal Server Errors
  - **Root Causes**: 
    - Complex SQL queries with JOINs causing database errors in `getAll()` and `getScheduledAppointments()` methods
    - Missing error handling and try-catch blocks in controller methods
    - Incorrect endpoint call in JavaScript (`counselor/get_scheduled_appointments` - non-existent endpoint)
    - **Database Column Issues**: `u.name` column reference in Student/Notifications.php (column doesn't exist in users table)
  - **Solution**: 
    - Simplified SQL queries to prevent JOIN-related errors
    - Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error logging
    - Removed incorrect endpoint call from JavaScript
    - Added COALESCE functions for safe data handling
    - **Fallback Query System**: Added robust fallback mechanism for JOIN failures
    - **Database Column Fix**: Changed `u.name` to `u.username` in Student/Notifications.php
    - Improved error messages and debugging capabilities
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `app/Controllers/Admin/Appointments.php`: Fixed `getAll()` and `getScheduledAppointments()` methods with Query Builder approach
    - `app/Controllers/Student/Notifications.php`: Fixed database column reference from `u.name` to `u.username`
    - `public/js/admin/scheduled_appointments.js`: Removed incorrect endpoint call and improved calendar integration
  - **Final Solution**: Exact counselor pattern - copied working raw SQL query but removed WHERE clause for admin (shows ALL appointments)
  - **Result**: Both admin appointments pages now load data correctly without 500 errors
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Schedule appointment button loading state bug:
  - **Issue**: Schedule appointment button was showing "Processing..." loading state on page load instead of only when clicked
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `.hidden` CSS class definition and improper button state initialization
  - **Solution**: Added `.hidden` class to CSS and created `initializeButtonState()` function to ensure proper initial state
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added `.hidden { display: none !important; }` to `public/css/student/student_schedule_appointment.css`
    - Created `initializeButtonState()` function in `public/js/student/student_schedule_appointment.js`
    - Called initialization function early in DOMContentLoaded event to prevent loading state on page load
    - Ensured button starts in normal state (submit text visible, loading indicator hidden, button enabled)
  - **Result**: Button now only shows loading state when actually clicked, maintaining proper UX flow
- **CRITICAL FIX**: PWD proof file deletion bug in student profile PDS system:
  - **Issue**: Existing PWD proof files were being deleted when updating other profile information (name, course, etc.)
  - **Root Cause**: `handlePWDProofUpload()` method returned 'N/A' when no new file was uploaded, overwriting existing file paths
  - **Solution**: Modified method to preserve existing files when no new file is uploaded
  - **Implementation**: Added `getExistingPWDProofFile()` helper method to retrieve current file path from database
  - **Result**: PWD proof files now persist correctly during profile updates unless explicitly replaced

- Map appointments lifecycle and confirm data model
- Document API endpoints and request/response contracts

- Validate header/menu behavior across user pages (dashboard, profile)
