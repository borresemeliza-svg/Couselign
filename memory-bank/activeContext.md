Focus: Follow-up Appointments System CSRF and Database Constraint Fixes

Recent Changes:
- Counselor messaging names: Updated `app/Controllers/Counselor/Message.php` in `getConversations` and `getDashboardMessages` to LEFT JOIN `student_personal_info` and return `COALESCE(CONCAT(spi.last_name, ', ', spi.first_name), u.username)` as `other_username`, so counselor dashboard/messages show student last and first name instead of username.
  - No JS changes required; existing UI uses `other_username`.
  - Type-safe SQL and minimal scope: only counselor messaging queries touched.

Recent Changes:
- Added follow-up session management actions:
  - Endpoints: complete (`POST counselor/follow-up/complete`) and cancel with reason (`POST counselor/follow-up/cancel`)
  - Routes registered under counselor group
  - UI: Added cancel-reason modal; buttons added next to Create Next Follow-up
  - Logic: Hide Create New Follow-up when sessions exist; enable Create Next only when last session is completed; disable Mark as Completed when already completed; Cancel only for pending sessions
  - CSRF: All forms/requests carry CSRF tokens; AJAX adds `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed 400 Bad Request error in follow-up appointment creation:
  - **Root Cause 1**: Missing CSRF token in follow-up form causing authentication failure
  - **Root Cause 2**: Database constraint mismatch - `counselor_id` field is `varchar(10)` in database but model validation was set to `max_length[100]`
  - **Solution 1**: Added CSRF token to follow-up form:
    - Added `<input type="hidden" name="<?= csrf_token() ?>" value="<?= csrf_hash() ?>">` to form
    - Added `<meta name="csrf-token" content="<?= csrf_hash() ?>">` to page head
    - Added `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to fetch request
  - **Solution 2**: Fixed database constraint validation:
    - Updated model validation rule from `max_length[100]` to `max_length[10]` for `counselor_id`
    - Added counselor ID length validation in controller before database insertion
    - Added comprehensive debug logging to track counselor ID length and validation
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Added extensive logging to track the exact cause of 400 errors:

    - Logs counselor ID length against database constraint
    - Logs all received form data for debugging
    - Logs validation errors with specific field names
  - **Type Safety**: Maintained comprehensive error handling and validation:

  - **Impact**: Counselor announcements page now properly loads announcements and events data

## Active Context

### Current focus
- Updated signup verification token format:

  - All signup and resend verification flows continue to work without change to controllers/routes.
  - Verification modal updated to 6-box input UI with auto-advance and paste support:
    - View: `app/Views/auth/verification_prompt.php` (six single-character inputs)
    - JS: `public/js/auth/verification_prompt.js` (combines inputs, validates, submits)
    - CSS: `public/css/auth/verification_prompt.css` (layout and focus styles)
- **COMPLETED**: Implemented counselor profile page as complete duplicate of user profile page with specified modifications:

### Newly fixed
- Counselor rejection reason modal auto-close and auto-reject bug:
  - Root cause: `public/js/counselor/appointments.js` attached a footer click handler in `updateModalButtons()` that directly invoked `updateAppointmentStatus(..., 'rejected')` when clicking `#rejectAppointmentBtn`, bypassing the rejection-reason flow.
  - Fix: Removed the auto-reject click binding from the pending-state footer; rejection now routes exclusively through the `rejectionReasonModal` → confirmation modal flow, preserving user input for the rejection reason.
  - Scope: Minimal JS-only change; no controllers, routes, or unrelated functions modified.

   - Scope-limited: No unrelated functions changed
